### Program Name: **_`Basic Data Analysis`_ Using `R`**

### Description:


This project showcases a basic data analysis workflow using R programming language. It focuses on data cleaning, data visualization, and data analysis techniques. The project utilizes two datasets:

1. **Health Care Dataset**: The first dataset is obtained from Kaggle, titled "Healthcare Analytics II," containing over 15 columns and over 300,000 rows of health care-related data. This dataset provides a rich set of information to perform various data analysis tasks.
2. **National Salaries Dataset**: The second dataset is a national salaries dataset with approximately 36,000 rows and over 20 columns. This dataset allows for exploration and analysis of salary-related data.

The main files in this project are `salaries.r` and `hospital.r`, which correspond to the respective datasets. These files encompass the core data analysis operations and provide insights into how to clean, visualize, and analyze the data effectively.

Key Features of the Project:

* **Data Cleaning**: The scripts demonstrate techniques to clean the data by handling missing values, standardizing column names, converting data types, and addressing outliers.
* **Data Visualization**: The project employs the `ggplot2` library to create visually appealing and informative graphs. The visualizations help understand the distributions, relationships, and patterns present in the datasets.
* **Data Analysis**: The project showcases various data analysis techniques, such as aggregating data, calculating descriptive statistics, identifying trends, exploring correlations, and deriving meaningful insights from the datasets.

This project serves as a valuable portfolio piece, demonstrating proficiency in data analysis using R. By examining the provided scripts, readers can gain insights into the process of preparing, visualizing, and analyzing large-scale datasets from different domains. The project emphasizes the importance of data quality, effective visualization techniques, and data-driven decision-making.

### How to run the project:

1. Ensure you have R installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
3. Open the R file `main.r` using an R integrated development environment (IDE) such as RStudio.
4. Install the necessary R packages mentioned in the scripts, if not already installed.
5. Update the file paths in the scripts to point to the location of the dataset files on your system.
6. Execute the scripts line by line or run the entire script to perform data cleaning, visualization, and queries.
7. Review the results and accuracy metrics displayed in the console.

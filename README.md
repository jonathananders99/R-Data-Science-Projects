# R Data Science Projects

This repository contains two data science projects implemented in R. The projects focus on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning using R programming language.

## Project 1: Basic Data Analysis Using R

The "Basic Data Analysis" project showcases a fundamental data analysis workflow using R. It covers data cleaning, data visualization, and data analysis techniques. The project utilizes two datasets: a health care dataset and a national salaries dataset.

## Project 2: Machine Learning Using R

The "Machine Learning" project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques using R. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and prediction using two datasets: "Healthcare Analytics II" and "Home Credit Default Risk."

Please refer to the individual project folders for more detailed information on each project.

 **Note** : For detailed steps on how to run each project, please refer to the respective project's README file within its individual folder.

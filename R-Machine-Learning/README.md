### Program Name: **_`Machine Learning`_ Using `R`**

### Description:

This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques using R programming language. It serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and prediction using two datasets: **Healthcare Analytics II** and  **Home Credit Default Risk** .

The **Healthcare Analytics II** dataset, obtained from Kaggle, consists of over 300,000 rows and contains various healthcare-related information. The dataset has been processed and analyzed using R to demonstrate effective data preprocessing techniques for machine learning tasks in the healthcare domain.

The **Home Credit Default Risk** dataset, also sourced from Kaggle, comprises over 120 columns and more than 300,000 rows. The project includes the necessary data preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for model training. Various machine learning models are then trained and evaluated using this dataset.

The project consists of two main files: `credit.r` and `hospital.r`. These files contain the code and workflows for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction using the respective datasets. The code demonstrates essential techniques such as handling missing values, feature encoding, data normalization, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

This project is intended to serve as a comprehensive demonstration of machine learning techniques in R, showcasing the ability to preprocess data, train models, and make predictions using trained models. It provides valuable insights into real-world applications of machine learning in the healthcare and credit risk domains.

### How to run the project:

1. Ensure you have R installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
3. Open the R files `credit.r` and `hospital.r` using an R integrated development environment (IDE) such as RStudio.
4. Install the necessary R packages mentioned in the scripts, if not already installed.
5. Update the file paths in the scripts to point to the location of the dataset files on your system.
6. Execute the scripts line by line or run the entire script to perform data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
7. Review the results and accuracy metrics displayed in the console.
